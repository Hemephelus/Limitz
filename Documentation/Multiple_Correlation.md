   1. ### Description of the function
   
        **Multiple correlation** is a statistical technique that is used to evaluate the relationship between multiple predictor variables and a single outcome variable. It is used to determine how well a set of predictor variables can predict the value of the outcome variable (By Chat GPT).

        For example, let's say we are interested in studying the relationship between three predictor variables (X1, X2, and X3) and one outcome variable (Y). We can use multiple correlation to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome variable (By Chat GPT).

   2. ### Return Value:

      For this function we return a 2D array of computed values of multiple correlation coefficient (R). each value shows the level of correlation each one has with each other.

   3. ### Sample Usage
      `MultipleCorrelation(B2:G42)`
     
   4. ### Syntax
      `
      MultipleCorrelation(data)
      `
      #
      `data -(Numbers):`

      The range of cells to perform the calculations on.
