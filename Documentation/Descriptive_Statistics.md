   1. ### Description of the function
   
      **Descriptive statistics** helps to make sense of large amounts of data and to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. It is a useful tool for understanding data and for making informed decisions based on that understanding. Some common types of descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (such as mean, median, and mode), measures of dispersion (such as range, variance, and standard deviation).

   2. ### Return Value:

      For This function we return a summary of computed values using these calculations: 
    
      Mean,Sum,Minimum,Maximum,Observation,Median,Standard Deviation,Skewness,Kurtosis,Sum of Squares.

   3. ### Sample Usage
      `DescriptiveStatistics(B2:G42,A2 or 1)`
     
   4. ### Syntax
      `
      DescriptiveStatistics(data,header)
      `
      #
      `data -(Numbers):`

      The range of cells to perform the calculations on.

      `header - (Boolean):`

      To confirm if there is a header row type "1". If not type "0".
