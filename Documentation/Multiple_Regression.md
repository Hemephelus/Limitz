   1. ### Description of the function
   
        **Multiple linear regression** is a statistical technique that is used to predict the value of a continuous outcome variable (also known as the dependent variable) based on the values of multiple predictor variables (also known as the independent variables). It is an extension of simple linear regression, which is used to predict the value of an outcome variable based on the value of a single predictor variable.

   2. ### Return Value:

      For this function we return a  2D array of computed values of the unique contribution of each predictor (independent variable) to the outcome (dependent variable). 


   3. ### Sample Usage
      `MultipleLinearRegression(B2:G42, 1 or A2)`
      
     
   4. ### Syntax
      `
      MultipleLinearRegression(data,dependent_variable)
      `
      #
      `data -(Numbers):`

      The range of cells to perform the calculations on.

      `dependent_variable -(Number):`

      The column the would be considers to be the dependent variable
